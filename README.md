# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Projects

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.  

## Table of Contents

### Projects

The labs and projects can be found below.  All of the projects use rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). In the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program, you will receive a review of your project.  These reviews are meant to give you personalized feedback and to tell you what can be improved in your code.

* [Navigation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p1_navigation): In the first project, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
* [Continuous Control](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control): In the second project, you will train an robotic arm to reach target locations.
* [Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p3_collab-compet): In the third project, you will train a pair of agents to play tennis!

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).

3. Install PyTorch
```bash
conda install pytorch=0.4.0 -c pytorch
```

	
4. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

5. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

6. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
